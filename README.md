Project title: BTS on Gaon Music Chart

Inspiration and Idea:
Being a music nerd and a huge BTS fan for so long, I have been following the music industry and the trends both worldwide and specifically with a focus on South Korea. I have been gathering data each week for songs mostly from their new studio album 'Map Of The Soul: 7' and analyzing the ranks, streams from the Gaon Digital Weekly Chart. So, when I gathered weekly data for the entire of 2020, I made this into a dataset. I got the streams, gaon digital index, and ranking from the Gaon Music Chart published each week. Then I created an interactive web app using Streamlit and performed data visalization using Plotly.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61077291/154817700-a06b003b-2af6-483f-95aa-4d06fc79be8c.png)
